New package pre-release Version 0.0-1

	The panel unit root tests developed in Choi (2001), Demetrescu et al. (2006), 
	Hanck (2008) and Costantini and Lupi (2010) have been implemented via the 
	pCADFtest() and Simes() functions.

	New functions:
	-	The function pCADFtest() performs the panel unit root tests described
		in detail in Costantini and Lupi (2011).
	-	The function Simes() computes the intersection test advocated in Hanck (2008).
		It uses the output of pCADFtest().

	New data:
	-	OECD data on 8 countries has been added in order to provide simple 
		examples for the panel test. Data are from the public OECD.Stat Extract
		repository.

	New methods:
	-	the summary-method produces an object of class "pCADFtestsummary".
