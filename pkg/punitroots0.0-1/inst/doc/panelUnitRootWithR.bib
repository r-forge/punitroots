  abstract = {This paper proposes unit root tests for dynamic heterogeneous panels
	based on the mean of individual unit root statistics. In particular
	it proposes a standardized t-bar test statistic based on the (augmented)
	Dickey-Fuller statistics averaged across the groups. Under a general
	setting this statistic is shown to converge in probability to a standard
	normal variate sequentially with T (the time series dimension) approaches
	infinity, followed by N (the cross sectional dimension) approaches
	infinity. A diagonal convergence result with T and N approaches infinity
	while N/T approaches k, k being a finite non-negative constant, is
	also conjectured. In the special case where errors in individual
	Dickey-Fuller (DF) regressions are serially uncorrelated a modified
	version of the standardized t-bar statistic is shown to be distributed
	as standard normal as N approaches infinity for a fixed T so long
	as T > 5 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and T > 6
	in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and linear time trends.
	An exact fixed N and T test is also developed using the simple average
	of the DF statistics. Monte Carlo results show that if a large enough
	lag order is selected for the underlying ADF regressions, then the
	small sample performances of the t-bar test is reasonably satisfactory
	and generally better than the test proposed by Levin and Lin (Unpublished

	5% tests with actual sizes 4% and 6% should not have their powers
	naively compared. In this paper the basic problem of trading off

	dependence of any fixed order p, as well as the case where no a priori
