%% an abstract and keywords
\Abstract {
This paper briefly reviews the panel unit root tests implemented in \proglang{R}. All the presently available functions are implemented in either the \pkg{plm} package \citep{croissantmillo2008} or the \pkg{CADFtest} package \citep{lupi2009, costantinilupi2011}. The performance of the tests is compared using some Monte Carlo experiments carried out under a fairly realistic Data Generating Process. The practical application of the different tests is illustrated using international unemployment data.
